    """
    This class is devoted to numerically solve a general PDE 
    
        U_t + F[U_x,U_{xx},Uâ€“{xxx},..] = C(t),
        
    still not specifying the method, over the spatial domain of xmin <= x <= xmax
    that is discretized with a given step dx, and a time domain 0 <= t <= tmax
    that is discretized with a given time step dt.
    
    Boundary conditions given as attributes of the class are applied at both ends
    of the domain. An initial condition is applied at t = 0. This can be seen
    as the payoff of an option. In this case, time represents maturity. 
    
    It is extended by classes representing the specific PDE and the specific
    method.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    dx : float
        discretization step on the space
    dt : float
        discretization step on the time
    xmin : float
        left end of the space domain
    xmax : float
        right end of the space domain
    tmax : float
        right end of the time domain
    x : float
        the dsicretized space domain
    numberOfSpaceSteps : int
        the number of intervals of the space domain
    numberOfTimeSteps : int
        the number of intervals of the time domain
    payoff : function
        the initial condition. Called in this way because it corresponds to 
        payoff of an option seeing time as maturity
    functionLeft : function
        the condition at the left end of the space domain. Default: None
    functionRight : function
        the condition at the right end of the space domain. Default:None
    currentTime : int
        the current time. The PDE is solved going forward in time. Here the
        current time is used to plot the solution dynamically and to compute 
        the solution at the next time step in the derived classes.
                                                              
        

    Methods

    solveAndSave():
        It solves the PDE and store the solution as a matrix in the self.solution
        attribute of the class. It also returns it.
